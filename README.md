# Pub-Order

[![Tests](https://github.com/hamayunrz/Pub-Order/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/hamayunrz/Pub-Order/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

Pub-Order is a web application designed to make ordering food from Vanderbilt's Pub faster and more convenient for students.

The goal of the project is to allow students to view available menu items, place an order, and track their pickup status without having to wait in line.

## Features

- Student login and authentication
- View current menu items
- Add items to a cart
- Place food orders
- View order status
- Estimated wait times
- Simple interface designed for Vanderbilt students

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React (Vite)

### Backend
- FastAPI
- Python

### Database and Authentication
- Supabase
- Supabase Auth

## Run locally

First, copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the repo root and fill in the Supabase URL and anon key.

Before browsing the database menu, apply `supabase/migrations/202610120001_menu_items.sql` once in the intended Supabase project. See [Hamayun’s US1/US2 walkthrough](docs/hamayun-us1-us2.md) for setup, the meal-swipe rules, API contract, tests, and the US3 handoff.

Frontend (Node.js 22.12+):

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

Backend (Python 3.10+), in a separate terminal. It must run on port 8001, because the frontend forwards `/api` requests there.

```sh
cd backend
python -m venv .venv            # macOS/Linux: python3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1      # macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

You only need to create the venv and run `pip install` the first time. After that, activate the venv and start `uvicorn`.

If Windows says running scripts is disabled when you activate the venv, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` once.

The frontend opens on the login page. The backend's API docs (Swagger) are at http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs.

## Running tests

Unit tests replace Supabase with a fake, so they don't need a `.env` file or a network connection.

Backend, from `backend/` with the virtual environment active:

```sh
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt       # pinned versions
ruff check .                              # lint
mypy                                      # type check
pytest -m "not integration"               # unit tests
pytest -m integration                     # integration tests (need local Supabase, below)
pytest --cov=app --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing
```

Frontend, from `frontend/`:

```sh
npm run lint              # ESLint
npm run test:unit         # unit and component tests
npm run test:integration  # *.integration.test.jsx
npm run coverage          # all Vitest tests with branch coverage (fails below 70%)
npm run test:cart         # cart logic tests only
npm run build             # production build
```

End-to-end (Playwright), from `frontend/`. The first time, download the browser with `npx playwright install chromium`.

```sh
npm run test:e2e    # starts the dev server itself (and the backend when a test user is set)
```

**Integration tests use a throwaway local Supabase**, never the team's hosted project. In CI, [start-local-supabase.sh](.github/scripts/start-local-supabase.sh) starts it in Docker, applies `supabase/migrations`, and creates a test user. To run these tests yourself, install Docker and the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development), run `supabase start` from the repo root, and set `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, `PUB_ORDER_TEST_EMAIL`, `PUB_ORDER_TEST_PASSWORD` and `PUB_ORDER_TEST_SERVICE_KEY` to the local values. Tests that change data refuse to run unless `SUPABASE_URL` is `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`. The test variables deliberately don't start with `SUPABASE_`, because the frontend sends every `SUPABASE_*` value to the browser.

**CI/CD.** GitHub Actions ([tests.yml](.github/workflows/tests.yml)) runs on every pull request and every push to `main`:

- **backend** and **frontend:** install → lint → type check (backend only) → unit tests → integration tests → coverage report, stopping at the first failure. The backend job also checks the menu migration and its permissions.
- **e2e:** browser tests against the real stack after both pass.
- **deliver:** on every push to `main`, packages a versioned, runnable build (`pub-order-0.3.<run>-<commit>.zip`, run with `uvicorn serve:app`) as a workflow artifact. Pushing a `sprint3` tag also publishes it as a GitHub Release.

The frontend job also checks that the production build succeeds. See [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) for a list of every test and what it checks.

For trying the API by hand, use the Swagger UI at `/docs` on the running backend.
